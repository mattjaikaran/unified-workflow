# Torque Health Check

Verify that GSD and Superpowers are installed correctly and the current project has no configuration conflicts.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Check GSD installation

```bash
# Check for GSD tools
ls ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs 2>/dev/null && echo "GSD_INSTALLED=true" || echo "GSD_INSTALLED=false"

# Get GSD version
cat ~/.claude/get-shit-done/VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "GSD_VERSION=unknown"

# Check GSD skills are registered
ls ~/.claude/skills/gsd-* 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

### Step 2: Check Superpowers installation

```bash
# Check for core SP skills (required)
for skill in systematic-debugging test-driven-development brainstorming writing-plans subagent-driven-development requesting-code-review verification-before-completion finishing-a-development-branch receiving-code-review; do
  if ls ~/.claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null > /dev/null; then
    echo "  ✓ $skill"
  else
    echo "  ✗ $skill (MISSING)"
  fi
done

# Check for extended SP skills (optional but recommended)
echo ""
echo "Extended skills:"
for skill in grill-me improve-codebase-architecture write-a-prd prd-to-issues changelog-generator webapp-testing playwright-skill ci-cd monitoring-observability; do
  if ls ~/.claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null > /dev/null; then
    echo "  ✓ $skill"
  else
    echo "  ○ $skill (optional, not installed)"
  fi
done
```

### Step 3: Check Torque installation

```bash
# Verify this skill is properly installed
ls ~/.claude/skills/torque/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "TORQUE_INSTALLED=true" || echo "TORQUE_INSTALLED=false"
```

### Step 4: Project-level checks

Run these checks in the current working directory:

1. **Mixed plan locations**: Flag if both `.planning/` AND `docs/plans/` exist
2. **Orphaned .planning/**: Flag if `.planning/` exists but has no `PROJECT.md` (manually created)
3. **Stale state**: Flag if `.planning/STATE.md` references a phase that doesn't have a directory
4. **Missing reviews**: Flag if any phase has `VERIFICATION.md` but no code review was done (check git log for review commits)

### Step 5: Output format

```

### Dependencies
| System | Status | Version |
|--------|--------|---------|
| GSD | ✓ Installed | 1.34.2 |
| Superpowers | ✓ Installed (8/8 core skills) | — |
| Torque | ✓ Installed | 0.3.0 |

### Project Checks
✓ Plan location is consistent (.planning/ only)
✓ STATE.md references valid phases
✗ Phase 2 was verified but never code-reviewed

### Recommendations
- Run `requesting-code-review` for Phase 2 before merging
```

If a dependency is missing:

## Rules

- Never modify any files. This is read-only.
- Check all dependencies even if the first one fails.
- Be specific about what's wrong and how to fix it.
